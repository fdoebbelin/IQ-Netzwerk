The following features are provided by this plugin:

- File indexing (using Apache Tika)
- Search result ranking
- Search term highlighting
- Group support (new in Moodle 3.5)
- Ordering by course and context (new in Moodle 3.5)

## File Indexing Support

This plugin uses [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) for file indexing support. Tika parses files, extracts the text, and return it via a REST API.

### Tika Setup

Seting up a Tika test service is straight forward. In most cases on a Linux environment, you can simply download the Java JAR then run the service.

Make sure java is installed:

```
$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre-headless
```

Then download and start Tika:

```
$ wget http://apache.mirror.amaze.com.au/tika/tika-server-1.16.jar
$ java -jar tika-server-1.16.jar
```

This will start Tika on the host. By default the Tika service is available on: `http://localhost:9998`

### Enabling File indexing support in Moodle

Once a Tika service is available the Postgres Full-Text plugin in Moodle needs to be configured for file indexing support.  
Assuming you have already followed the basic installation steps, to enable file indexing support:

1. Configure the plugin at: *Site administration > Plugins > Search > Postgres Full Text.
2. Select the _Enable file indexing_ checkbox.
3. Set _Tika URL_, including the port number e.g. [http://localhost:9998](http://localhost:9998).
4. Click the _Save Changes_ button.

### What is Tika

From the [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) website:

> The Apache Tikaâ„¢ toolkit detects and extracts metadata and text from over a thousand different file types (such as PPT, XLS, and PDF). All of these file types can be parsed through a single interface, making Tika useful for search engine indexing, content analysis, translation, and much more. You can find the latest release on the download page. Please see the Getting Started page for more information on how to start using Tika.
